# Cursor AI Rules for MultiCAFE Project

## File Modifications
- Only modify files locally, never commit changes
- All file changes remain on local disk until explicitly committed by the user
- Never run git commit, git push, or any version control operations

## Project Context
- Always read ./Cursor_setup/PROJECT_CONTEXT_DATABASE.md whenever the user starts a new chat
- Avoid redundant comments
